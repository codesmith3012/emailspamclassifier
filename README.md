Email Spam Classifier Using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based email spam classifier that identifies whether an email is spam or not. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the email text and applies machine learning models to classify emails as "spam" or "not spam" based on their content.

Features
Email Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, removal of stopwords, and vectorization of email content.
Machine Learning Models: Implements and compares models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness.
User Interface: A simple interface to input email text and get spam classification results.
Use Cases
Email Filtering: Automatically classify and filter out spam emails from legitimate emails.
Business Email Systems: Enhance email services with automated spam detection.
Personal Email Management: Use the classifier to organize personal emails more effectively.
Technologies & Libraries
Python: Core language for building the classifier.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model building, training, and evaluation.
NLTK & Spacy: For natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text cleaning and tokenization.
Flask (optional): To create a simple web interface for the classifier.
